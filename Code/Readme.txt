The code file includes the python and r code we developed in this study.



"Python-code" folder includes the python code used to:
1. Create functions to modify the life cycle inventory (LCI) background database (ecoinvent 3.6) ("1_Functions_Market_electricity_data.ipynb" and "2_Database_input_modification.ipynb")
2. Run the Life cycle assessment (LCA) model, and calculate the LCA result of DACCS technologies and electricity generation ("3. LCA_calculation.ipynb" and "4. LCA_electricity_generation.ipynb")
3. Import and analyze IMAGE raw data ("5. IMAGE_results_calculation.ipynb")

The "Python_code_result_export" folder in "Python-Code" folder includes all results exported from the python code. These results are further post-processed and used to make figures of this study using R-code



"R-code" folder includes the r code used to:
1. Post-process the results in the "Python_code_result_export" folder
2. Making the figures. 

The "R_code_result_export" folder in the "R-Code" folder includes all the results used to make the figures. 
Figure_2_data.xlsx includes the data used to make SI-Figure 2, SI-Figure 3, SI-Figure 4, and SI-Figure 5
